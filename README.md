In bacterial research, there is a great imbalance in the information available for each species. While a few species are well studied, for the vast majority of bacteria, only incomplete information is available. To make matters worse, the number of scientific publications is increasing every year. Due to this problem, a Python framework is being developed. The task of the framework is to extract information from dynamic web pages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

This repository contains the complete Python code and all output files that were created during the writing of the bachelor thesis.

Bachelor thesis topic:

The content of the repository is by Florian Richter. The bachelor thesis was written at the TH KÃ¶ln.
